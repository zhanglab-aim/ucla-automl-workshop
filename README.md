# ucla-automl-workshop
AutoML workshop for UCLA QCBio Collaboratory, Winter 2023

## Jupyter Notebooks
`UCLA_AutoML_workshop_Day1.ipynb` contains basic code for Day 1. Building CNNs and Model Evaluation.

`UCLA_AutoML_workshop_Day2.ipynb` contains basic code for Day 2. AutoML and Model Explanation.

`UCLA_AutoML_workshop_Day0.ipynb` contains data simulation functions if you are interested generating your own sequence data.

Clicking on the Icon "Open in Colab" on the top of each notebook will connect to a cloud-based virtual Jupyter notebook, hosted by Google Colab. These notebooks are self-contained and are tested to run ok in Jan 2023.

If you find an issue in running these notebooks, leave a [Github Issue](https://github.com/zhanglab-aim/ucla-automl-workshop/issues).
